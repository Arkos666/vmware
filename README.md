# vmware
Tests for python

My first python script, I see a a lot of issues to improve (best paractices, error control, launch, etc.) I will improve it if I use it XD 

I'm preparing this project to practice my Python skills and improve them.
At this moment I've created a little script to find vmware path by register and putty through program files.

Then I launch vmware and connect to it by Putty.

My next step will be include parameters.
